/* 
Loop Challenge:
Create a function called: vowelCounter that returns the count of vowels in encounters in the string.

In this challenge, you'll need to use a loop to iterate through each character in the input string. To count the number of vowels, you can check if each character is equal to any of the vowels ("a", "e", "i", "o", "u") in either uppercase or lowercase. If a character is a vowel, you can increment a counter variable to keep track of the number of vowels found.

EX: vowelCounter("calIfornIa")   - expected output: 4

Extra Spice: See if you can create it utilizing an arrow function.
